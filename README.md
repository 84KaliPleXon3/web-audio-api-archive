# The Web Audio API archive

## Description

This project attempts to archive the Web Audio API Specification as it's
evolved through time.  It does so by collecting all the commits from the
[webaudio/web-audio-api](https://github.com/webaudio/web-audio-api/) git
repository and analyzing them.  It tries to create a snapshot of the page
as it existed at that time, as well as let's you preview the state of the
spec using 3rd Party tools like
[Rawgit](https://rawgit.com/) and
[The Internet Archive's Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/web.php).
